    "\n",
    "* Anthropogenic way of solving human cause pollution. Is it that low Carbon? As long as not producing noxious emissions by directly burning it that is relatively correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recovered waste heat generated during industrial processes can be repurposed to provide electricity, heating and/or hot water.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Waste to Energy **(WtE)** or Energy from Waste **(EfW)**, known colloquially as **“trash-to-cash”**, is a renewable solution that can provide low carbon electricity as well as capture the waste heat generated during the process and utilize in the form of district heating.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **WtE** is a heavily regulated, technically complex sector, but is gaining momentum as **WtE** projects are expected to play a critical role in delivering the Scottish government’s landfill ban, which comes into effect in 2025. Make sure we are just not transforming a landfilling problem to uncontrolled burning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points for Building an **EfW Plant**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sufficient feedstock volumes, processing needs, storage; adequate road network to facilitate **HGV** deliveries. HGV - Heavy Goods Vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Permission needed from local authority; can apply directly to UK government.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Must have an Environmental Permit to operate from the Environment Agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In operation, extensive, detailed monitoring requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Delicate process to steer an **EfW** projects to market with the full support of communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strict & detailed; imperative to involve experts to navigate the legal requirements from the planning phase through to operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find the right spot, strategically well placed to ensure there is a constant inflow of waste to keep the energy production going. Space, place for expansion are also important considerations. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Monitor **KPIs** constantly. Related from waste source (legal), energy production, utilization and usage - very delicate area. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Transform public, community opposition to acceptance and then **Engagement** and **Participation** - maybe consider crowd funding, private investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Legislation covering EfW\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) (**PPC**) Regulations 2012.\n",
    "2. European Waste Incineration Directive (**WID**).\n",
    "3. Grid connection consent.\n",
    "4. Building control consent.\n",
    "5. Planning consent.\n",
    "6. Environmental permit.\n",
    "7. Protected species licences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points for Building \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Waste trucks are weighed on arrival, then unloaded & mixed using cranes. Tipping hall & waste bunker kept at negative air pressure to capture odors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Waste is loaded into hoppers to feed 3 combustion chambers operating at <span style='color: magenta'>850°C</span>. Heat from burnt waste converts water in steel tube-lined walls into HP steam, which turns a turbine-driven generator to produce electricity for the Grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Steam is cooled, condensed back into water and returned to the boiler tubes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Combustion reduces the waste volume by 90%, leaving an inert ash and metals for recycling. Bottom ash from the grate is sent off site where metals are recovered for recycling. Fly ash collected in the air pollution control equipment and resulting residues (known as **APCr**) are stored in silos for removal from the site in sealed tanker vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Air pollution control ensures emissions fully comply with standards set out in the facility's Environmental Permit.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Throughout the process, emissions are checked via a real-time continuous emission monitoring system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WtE incineration vs. natural gas \n",
    "\n",
    "* <span style='color: magenta'>70 mt</span> of waste were incinerated in 2017, 118% more than in 1995.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Incineration of 1 t of waste releases <span style='color: magenta'>0.7 t to 1.7 t</span> of CO2.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Although, CO2 from **WtE** is released directly into the atmosphere, only CO2 emissions from fossil sources are considered for the purposes of a global analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As plastics are from fossil sources and are a significant proportion of the material burned, WtE fossil CO2 level is estimated to be <span style='color: magenta'>580g CO2/t</span> of waste combusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hence, electricity generated by WtE has much higher GHG emissions than electricity generated through conventional means, such as natural gas (<span style='color: magenta'>340g CO2eq/kWh</span>).\n",
    "\n",
    "* High proportion of recyclables in waste that could be recycled or composted, with a positive reduction on carbon emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Incinerators require a constant flow of waste to burn, which maintains or increases waste flows rather than reducing them. In the case of Rookery South ERF plant, waste is now brought in daily by diesel HGVs from all over Bedfordshire, adding to local traffic congestion, noise, and pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This will lock societies into a linear economy that justifies a throw-away culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The carbon intensity of energy from WtE incineration is twice that the current EU average electricity grid intensity and has much worse climate impacts than conventional electricity generation from fossil fuels such as gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As WtE plants are designed to last for 20-30 years, they are **delaying a much needed and urgent transition** to less carbon intensive power generation infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Promoting WtE could **undermine efforts** to reach net zero emissions by 2050."
